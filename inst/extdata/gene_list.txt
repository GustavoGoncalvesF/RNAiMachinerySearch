Category,Gene,Function
Dicer family,DICER,short dsRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing
Dicer family,DCR1,generates miRNAs by processing pre-miRNA
Dicer family,DCR2,responsible for producing siRNAs from long dsRNA
Dicer family,RNC,involved in the initial step of miRNA biogenesis
Argonautes,AGO1,main component of the RISC complex that binds to a short guide RNA such as miRNA or siRNA
Argonautes,AGO2,induces potent and specific gene silencing
Argonautes,AGO3,acts via the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) metabolic process
Argonautes,PIWI,form effector complexes known as piRNA-induced silencing complexes which repress transposons via transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms
Argonautes,SIWI,form effector complexes known as piRNA-induced silencing complexes which repress transposons via transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms
Argonautes,PIWL1,form effector complexes known as piRNA-induced silencing complexes which repress transposons via transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms
Argonautes,PIWL2,form effector complexes known as piRNA-induced silencing complexes which repress transposons via transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms
Argonautes,AUB,directly binds piRNAs
Argonautes,SPNE,acts via the piRNA metabolic process which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi and govern the methylation and subsequent repression of transposons
dsRNA binding,LOQS,double-stranded RNA-binding protein
dsRNA binding,DGCR8,required to process primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) to release precursor miRNA
dsRNA transport/uptake,SID1,channel for the transport of dsRNA between cells
dsRNA transport/uptake,SID2,mediate endocytic uptake of dsRNA ingested from the environment
dsRNA transport/uptake,SIDT2,mediate endocytic uptake of dsRNA ingested from the environment
dsRNA transport/uptake,CLH,endocytotic process
dsRNA transport/uptake,INX2,involved in forming intercellular channels
dsRNA transport/uptake,EPN,binds to membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositol 4.5-bisphosphate
dsRNA transport/uptake,SCRB1,mediated the uptake of exogenous dsRNAs in the induction of the RNAi responses
Auxiliary RISC-associated,ARMI,required for the assembly of the RISC complex
Auxiliary RISC-associated,DDX3,required for cellular function larval growth for male and female fertility and for RNAi
Auxiliary RISC-associated,CLP1,phosphorylates the 5-terminus of exogenously introduced siRNAs which is a necessary prerequisite for their incorporation into the RISC
Auxiliary RISC-associated,GAWKY,silences both polyadenylated and deadenylated mRNAs
Auxiliary RISC-associated,SND1,translation regulation throught its association with the RISC
Auxiliary RISC-associated,TSN,act as an activator of RISC by facilitating endonucleolytic cleavage of the siRNA passenger strand
Auxiliary RISC-associated,TSNAX,endonuclease involved in the activation of the RISC
Auxiliary RISC-associated,MAEL,piRNA and miRNA metabolic processes
Auxiliary RISC-associated,HENMT,adds a 2-O-methyl group at the 3-end of selected small RNAs
Auxiliary RISC-associated,STAU1,binds dsRNA (regardless of the sequence) and tubulin
